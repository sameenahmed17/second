Hi seeinindia,

The "Thank You" sale is live and some PRLeap members have already
taken advantage of the huge savings.

But I also received a bunch of questions about the new Expansion Pack
that will triple your media exposure, so I decided to put together a
Frequently Asked Questions update, just to clear up any questions you
might have.

Why will more media exposure for my business make a difference?
Because it can increase your authority and credibility in the
marketplace as a result of your press release being found across 100+
online media newsrooms (local television, newspaper and radio
stations).

You can also use a press release to build your positioning=E2=80=A6 what you
want your marketplace to think about you and your business.

Why is expansion pack distribution different than what comes standard?
Because your press release is placed in the lifestyle section of 100+
local television, newspaper and radio station's online media
newsrooms. In addition to getting placed in the business section of 50
online news and financial outlets.

Why does inclusion of my press release into Google News matter?
Because bloggers, reporters and customers use Google News alerts to be
notified of new content they care about. So, if you publish a press
release about a topic they=E2=80=99re monitoring, then your PRLeap press
release can come across their radar.

The truth is, Google News already sees your press release on PRLeap
and considers it for inclusion. Additionally, this new local media
distribution is typically included in Google News too. So, it=E2=80=99s a
win-win for you because it=E2=80=99s more visibility for your news and
business.

Are these links compliant with Google?
Yes the links in your press releases are published as no-follow links,
as Google recommends, on PRLeap and on across all the media sites
where your news is syndicated to. So you can benefit from the huge
media exposure right from the start.

Why do I have to wait one day to get a results report?
Because it takes time for all 150+ media outlets that picked up your
press release to report back. We automatically email you a copy of the
results report the next morning after it goes out.

Why does the Thank You Sale end tomorrow at Midnight?
Because we're sending our new media partner a big check to cover the
setup fee and usage credits next week. So if you want to get the
expansion pack and save 50%, you have to act quickly. You'll be glad
you did.
