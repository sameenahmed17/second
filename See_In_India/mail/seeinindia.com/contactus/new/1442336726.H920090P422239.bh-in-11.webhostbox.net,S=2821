Hi,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My Name is Mark Schmidt; I was dismissed from Wells Fargo Bank in 2012</DIV>
<DIV>
because my wife took me to court and accused me wrongly of constantly</DIV>
<DIV>
beating her. Her accusation where all lies but the court will not believe</DIV>
<DIV>
my plea because she and her lawyer boyfriend had perfected their lie. They</DIV>
<DIV>
did all that because of the money I kept in custody of my wife. Their</DIV>
<DIV>
accusation earned me a two years jail terms and the Bank capitalized on my</DIV>
<DIV>
wife's accusation and also sacked me. On my return from jail a company</DIV>
<DIV>
account of mine which had $78,000,000.00 in it went dormant.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
All I am requesting of you is that you present yourself as the owner of my</DIV>
<DIV>
company after our agreement then complete the account activation and</DIV>
<DIV>
evacuation of the above mentioned from that account.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I will give you all the details required to make this deal successful. You</DIV>
<DIV>
can also keep 20% of the fund when the deal is complete and pass the 80% to</DIV>
<DIV>
me.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I will guide you step by step until the deal is completed call me let’s</DIV>
<DIV>
talk: +1(305)320-3310; I think I can explain better face to face or on call.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I will prefer you respond to me on the email below. You can also search me</DIV>
<DIV>
on facebook with same email below so that we can talk it over.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I truly need your help!</DIV>
