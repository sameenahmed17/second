<div>Dear trekkers,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now you do not need to take time off your work days to trek in the =
Himalayas. Trek the Himalayas offers some great weekend treks that give =
you a substantial experience of trekking in the Himalayas over the =
weekend. These treks are easy and thus, need very basic fitness levels. =
Starting October 2015, you can skip your mundane weekend life and have a =
truly adventurous weekend at these treks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp312.com/uwsapaeuyyhadauquanahbbu/click.php">Nag Tibba =
Trek</a></b></div>
<div>This easy trail is in the Shivalik range of lower Himalayas. Thick =
pine forests, mountain brooks and slate-roofed villages are the unique =
highlights of this trek. As you walk along the trails of the forest, =
scenic views of the Gangotri, Banderpoonch, Kalanaag or Black Peak and the =
Swargarohini massif welcome you with their gigantic stature.&nbsp;</div>

Trek</a></b></div>
<div>The trek in the Kumaon region of Himalayas ensures that you make the =
most of your weekend. Starting at the picturesque Binsar Wildlife =
Sanctuary, the trek includes walks through pine forests accompanied by the =
music of tiny rivulets of clear water, spotting a few rare flora and fauna =
and camping amidst thick deodars to wonder about the breathtaking =
Himalayas.</div>

Chandrashila Deoria Tal Trek</a></b></div>
<div>For the next opportunity of a long weekend, we suggest you escape to =
this 4 day, easy trek. The trail leading you to Chopta is surrounded by =
luxurious natural meadows and the Himalayan ranges. The Tungnath peak at =
an altitude of 3680m is known to be the highest Shiva shrine on the globe. =
And lastly, the beauty of Deoriatal is not less than a fairy tale where =
you can see a few animals and birds drinking sparkling water from the =
lake. The snow clad hills will make you forget every worry and you =
experience sheer peace in the lap of Himalayas.</div>
