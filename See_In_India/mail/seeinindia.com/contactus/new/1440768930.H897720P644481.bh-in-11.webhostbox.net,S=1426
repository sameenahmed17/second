Greetings,  

 

I request cooperation with you in the sphere of financing viable projects with prospective returns on investment (R.O.I) in your region. I know that this mail might come to you as surprise because we neither know each other nor has ever met. I got your contact details in my search for a reliable partner, hence my contacting you.

  

Details of the investment funding will be furnished to you when I receive your reply mail which will also facilitate our face to face meeting.



 Yours Sincerely,



Natasha Fernandez
