the
winter holiday season and back-to-school?

spending is expected to reach $21.2 billion.* (Wow!)

convincing people to buy. Other tactics include Price Cuts and
Coupons.**

I=E2=80=99m sharing this with you
----------------------------------

Marketing is the lifeblood of your business. Without marketing there
are no sales.

You know what else happens in cycles? The news.

As National Best Selling Author, and former Director of Marketing for
American Apparel, Ryan Holliday says:

---------------------------

So if you want more press coverage for your business, start sending
out press releases.
