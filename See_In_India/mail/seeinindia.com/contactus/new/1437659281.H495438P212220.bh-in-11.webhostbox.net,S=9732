PRLeap

WOW - I=E2=80=99m simply overflowing with excitement right now.

Yesterday I emailed you (and everyone else on the PRLeap newsletter
list) and shared with you exciting news about how we are in the middle
of negotiations with a media company that has national reach.
Inclusion into their network would triple the size of the PRLeap Press
Release Distribution Network.

And then I asked everyone who would be interested in taking advantage
of the expanded distribution to reply and let me know, so we make sure
to buy enough volume to cover the initial demand.

In any case, the response was amazing! I've received 53 messages from
the PRLeap community=E2=80=A6 and they are continuing to pour into my inbox.
And so many of them said yes "I'm interested in tripling my
distribution."

Thank you, thank you, how exciting.

And if you haven't sent in your response yet, there is still time=E2=80=A6
just hit the reply button and let me know if you would be interested
in tripling the exposure your press release gets.

You see, in order for us to negotiate the best possible deal we need
to get an idea of how many PRLeap customers would want to take
advantage of the expanded distribution. So we make sure to buy enough
volume to cover the initial demand. On top of that, we have to write
them a big check to cover the setup fees.

Just hit the reply button, and simply tell me if you would be
interested in tripling the reach of your press releases, so you can
get more exposure for your news.

With much appreciation,
Mario
