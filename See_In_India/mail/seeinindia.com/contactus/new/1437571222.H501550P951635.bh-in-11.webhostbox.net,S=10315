PRLeap

Dear seeinindia,

It's Mario from PRLeap and I have some exciting news - and I am just a
bit nervous about sharing it=E2=80=A6

You see, even though Merrick and I have been doing this for over 12
years now, well=E2=80=A6 I'm usually reluctant about sharing something until
it's a done deal. Which is why I am a bit nervous=E2=80=A6

But I am just bursting with this news - so I decided it's time to come
out and share it with you:

We're in negotiations with a media company with national reach that is
considering the inclusion of PRLeap press releases into their network.
This would triple the size of the PRLeap Press Release Distribution
Network.

I am super excited - for lots of reasons=E2=80=A6

But let me tell you one of them - as you might imagine, it would
triple the reach of your news (so you'll be able to reach customers in
more places). And drive more traffic to your website (so you can
generate more leads and sales).

Anyway, there's a really good reason I'm telling you all this.

You see, in order for us to negotiate the best possible deal we need a
get idea of how many PRLeap customers would want to take advantage of
the expanded distribution. So we make sure to buy enough volume to
cover the initial demand. On top of that, we have to write them a big
check to cover the setup fees.

So now I have a favor to ask of you=E2=80=A6 it won't cost you a cent, just=
 a
minute or two of your time.

Just hit the reply button, and simply tell me if you would be
interested in tripling the reach of your press releases, so you can
more exposure for your news.

I am hoping to get hundreds (or even thousands) of responses=E2=80=A6 so we
can negotiate a good deal based on the amount of volume we can expect.

Just reply to this email and send me your feedback.

Best,
Mario
