E COMPUTER SYSTEM IN THE LAB SO THAT IT WILL APPEAR AS IF YOU ARE ONE OF TH=
E GENIUNE CONTRACTORS CLEARED FOR PAYMENT.
ACCORDING TO THEM, THEY WANTED TO USE THIS STRATEGY TO TRANSFER A HUGE AMOU=
NT OF U.S. DOLLARS WHICH THEY ACCUMULATED THROUGH INFLATED CONTRACT AWARDS =
AND THE MONEY HAS BEEN FLOATING IN THE CBN SINCE THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTORS H=
AVE BEEN PAID OFF, SO THEY WANTED TO USE YOUR ACCOUNT FOR TRANSFER.
WE AGREED THAT ONCE I DO THIS, THEY WOULD GIVE ME US$100,000.00 AND GIVE ME=
 ANOTHER US$100,000.00 WHEN I RELEASE THE FUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. WHEN THEY =

THEY BECAME ANGRY THE MORE WHEN THEY REALISED THAT THEIR THREAT DID NOT WOR=
K, AND STARTED BRIBING OTHER OFFICIALS TO GET ANOTHER APPROVAL TO TRANSFER =
THE MONEY TO YOU WITHOUT SUCCESS. APPROVALS ARE FREE. I AM 100% RESPONSIBLE=
 FOR THE DELAY AND OBSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF THEIR BREACH OF AGREEMENT. IF YOU=
 DOUBT WHAT I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU, PAY ANY AMOUNT THAT THEY WILL ASK YOU TO =
PAY NOW AND AFTER A SHORT WHILE THEY WILL COME UP WITH ANOTHER REASON FOR Y=

1. I WILL HAVE 30% OF THE MONEY BECAUSE IT IS ONLY TWO OF US LEFT FOR NOW
2. YOU WILL BEAR THE FULL COST OF THE TRANSFER
3. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WILL BE USELESS AND A MERE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IF=
 YOU CONTINUE WITH ANY OTHER PERSON, SO WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS TRANSACTION T=
