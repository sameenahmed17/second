Dear site owner or webmaster of seeinindia.com,

We recently discovered that some pages on your site look like a possible  
phishing attack, in which users are encouraged to give up sensitive  
information such as login credentials or banking information. We have  
removed the suspicious URLs from Google.com search results and have begun  
showing a warning page to users who visit these URLs in certain browsers  
that receive anti-phishing data from Google.

Below are one or more example URLs on your site which may be part of a  
phishing attack:

http://seeinindia .com/nchalhrzlt2
http://seeinindia .com/nchalhrzlt2/
http://www.seeinindia .com/nchalhrzlt2

Here is a link to a sample warning page:
http://www.google.com/interstitial?url=http%3A//seeinindia.com/nchalhrzlt2

We strongly encourage you to investigate this immediately to protect users  
who are being directed to a suspected phishing attack being hosted on your  
web site. Although some sites intentionally host such attacks, in many  
cases the webmaster is unaware because:

1) the site was compromised
2) the site doesn't monitor for malicious user-contributed content

If your site was compromised, it's important to not only remove the content  
involved in the phishing attack, but to also identify and fix the  
vulnerability that enabled such content to be placed on your site. We  
suggest contacting your hosting provider if you are unsure of how to  
proceed.

Once you've secured your site, and removed the content involved in the  
suspected phishing attack, or if you believe we have made an error and this  
is not actually a phishing attack, you can request that the warning be  
removed by visiting
http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/?tpl=emailer
and reporting an "incorrect forgery alert." We will review this request and  
take the appropriate actions.

Sincerely,
Google Search Quality Team

Note: if you have an account in Google's Webmaster Tools, you can verify  
the authenticity of this message by logging into  
https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/siteoverview and going to the  
Message Center, where a warning will appear shortly.
