Dear trusted friend.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I am Mrs&nbsp; Maria Ayman From LIBYA but now in hospital. I and husband were into, Real Estate Business and a Government Contractor before my husband’s death on May 25 2010. We were married for 15 years without a child due to my fibroid problem. And since my husband's death I have been diagnosed with orphanages, cancer that I hardly move around.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Recently,my Doctor told me that I would not last for next 6 weeks because the cancer has gotten to a very bad stage. When my husband was alive he made a deposit of $7.500.000.00 USD. Knowing my condition I have decided to donate this money out for charity purposes. Beloved one, I want to transfer this money to you, I want you to use at least 85% of this money to visit the orphanages homes, help the poor, sick ones in the hospital and woman with cancer then take the remaining amount to take care of your home because every worker deserve his wages. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money, my relatives are not Good,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
they are selfish, they frustrated my marriage life, because of my condition they turned their back on me thinking nothing good will come out from me since I am SICK AND CHILDLESS moreover I and my late husband vowed to use our last wealth to help the less privileged since we have no child. Please I don't need any telephone communication at all because of my health condition.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My dear, Reply me for me to give you other details. Proverbs 19:17 He who is gives to the poor lends to the lord and the lord will reward him for what he has done.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Thanks and be Blessed.</DIV>
<DIV>
Mrs Maria Ayman</DIV>
