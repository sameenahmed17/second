Hello,

I have written an earlier mail to you but no response.In my first mail I mentioned to you about my late client who deposited some fund with a bank here in Amsterdam - Netherlands before he died in April 2009. He bears the same surname with you.

Since his death the bank has tried to contact any member of his family but all to no avail.I have closely checked and since you bear the same surname with the deceased client it will be better to present you as the next of kin and the rightful beneficiary of the funds in the account.The total sum left in the account is EUR10M (Ten Million Euros) I will provide you with all the necessary legal backing that is required until this money is paid out to you, and then we shall share it base on our agreement.

Do respond quick if you are interested or should you need further clarification because we have no much time left.

Thanks you for your cooperation
Mr Alexander Tovil
