Hello, 



I hope this mail will find you having a wonderful time. My name is Dr. Michael Lbailey from England, I work as a Lab Scientist with a Pharmaceutical firm here in 



England. I am writing you because of a supply deal with good profit I would like to introduce to you if you will be interested and have the capability to handle the 



supply from India to the company where I work. I run the supply prior before now in partnership with an Nepalese from Kathmandu, but after the disastrous earthquake on 



April this year 2015 in the country, all effort to reach him via email and phone proved abortive. I need a reliable person to introduce to my company here in UK for 



constant supply and the product in question is normally come from northern part of India, and after each deal is successfully completed, you send me my share of the 



profit. Kindly revert back to get more details about the lucrative supply. Reply via this email: drmichaellbailey@yahoo.com       



Please ensure you reply on the above email to enable me reply to you on time.



Regards, 

Dr. Michael. Lbailey
