Hello.

I am Mr. Alex Logan, an Engineer with Exxon Mobil in London http://www.exxonmobil.co.uk). I got your contact address from an associate working with the British Export Promotion Council. Before I continue, let me stress that I am NOT contacting you for financial assistance.

I am in search of a business partner to assist us in the transfer of (GBP65m) and subsequent investment in properties or any other lucrative investment in your country.

If you decide to render your service to us in this regard, 15% of the total sum of (GBP65m) will be for you for your candid and sincere assistance.

Looking forward for your partnership,

Best Regards,
Mr. Alex Logan.
