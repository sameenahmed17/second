Dear sir, 

My name is Benmoore Donald, I am working With a Veterinary Company based here in London, UK. I got your contact during my comprehensive search for a reliable and trustworthy individual/company in your country. I decided to contact you for a business with our company. The company I work with is into manufacturing of Veterinary Medicines, animal food dietary and supplement for Horses, Elephants, Cows and Lions.
 
The company procures most of their raw materials from India in past 3 years; there is a chemical which the company used to send me to India to buy. Right now I have being promoted to the post of marketing manager. The company cannot send me to India again; they will send a more junior staff, our Director has asked me for the contact details of the supplier in India. I need a person I will present to the company as the supplier in India; the company will pay some percentage upfront, upon the verification of the sample of the chemical.

The profit would be share between you and I on 50-50 basis after the supply. I am looking for a reliable Indian business man that understands the India local language who will assist me in contacting the local dealer of these chemical in India. I don't want to contact them directly because they will take advantage on me; this business is 100% risk free and will be another income generating business outside your specialization. If you are interested to do the business with me kindly contact me for more details.
