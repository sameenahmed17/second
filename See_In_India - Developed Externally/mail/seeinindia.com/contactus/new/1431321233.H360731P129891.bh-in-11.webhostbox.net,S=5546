ASSALAM ALAIKUM


I know this may come as surprise and sceptic to you. Since we do not know each other, but I  am contacting you with trust and faith i have, that you will never fail me .


My name is Mrs. Samifa Fatun  a nationality of Kuwait. I am married to late Dr.Basmah Fatun who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year Octorber 2003. We were married for twenty years with a child. He died after a the illness that lasted for long four days. Before his death we were both a good Christian. When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $9.5MillionUSD (Nine Million Five hundred Thousand U.S.Dollars) with one of good banks here in Cote d'Ivoire.


Presently, this money is still with the bank. I have been diagnose with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer Problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this Fund to mosque or church better still a individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to Instruct here in. I want a Christian or Muslim member that will use this fund to orphanages, research centers and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.


The Holy Qur'an and Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore this is why i seek for your assistance, I once asked try a member of my family to distribute the money which I gave him to the charity organization here they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. I took this decision because I have a child  that will inherit this money but my son cannot carry out this work only because i and my late husband decide to use some of the money to work for God  and live some for our son to have a better live. Our son is just 17yearold now and been grow up in Africa, he have low mentality and my husband’s relatives are not Muslim even christain and I don’t want my family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I am presently placed on dialysis
 checkup
 and will not need telephone communication most of the time because of my heath and the presents of my husband’s relatives around me always. They have sold most of my husband’s property I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in any way that those not concern the will of God. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty God. I want your telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my family relatives around me always. I don’t want any of my husband family relatives to  receive this money. With God all things are possible.


As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and your Muslim individual to always pray for me because the Lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Muslim The Quran made us to understand that, "Whosoever fear God and keep his duty for him he will make a way for him to get out of  every difficulty and he will provide him from  every sources he could never imagined and whosoever put his trust in God then he will suffice him"(Al-Quran 65:2-3)The holy Quran also says if any do deeds of righteousness be they male or female and have faith, they will enter the Paradise and not the least injustice will be done to them(Al-Quran 4:124)The Holy Quran and bible also made it clear that, as a righteous person, God will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.


Whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth, Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a Christian or Muslim individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here. I pray to God for his providence for a smooth transfer. If this picks your interest, please do contact me immediately through this email address (faithsamif2015@yahoo.co.id) for more details.



Remain blessed in the name of God
Yours faithfully
Mrs Samifa Fatun
