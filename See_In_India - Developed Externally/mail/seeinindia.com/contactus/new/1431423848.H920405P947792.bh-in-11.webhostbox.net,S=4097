 Dear Sir /Madam

     I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you independently of my search of competent business contact while I was visiting Toronto Canada at the film festival, and no one is informed of this communication.

    I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2002 my client a reputable wife of an oil business tycoon in the Middle East was striped off her late husband's assets because of the limited human right in that part of the world, she is now seeking asylum in United Kingdom, fortunately now in UK she was able to retrieve some of her late husband's foreign asset/ funds which is estimated to be $35.2 USD Million.

At this point she is willing to invest $15.2 USD Million with a reliable business associate, as soon as we enter into proper agreement that funds could be shipped to you via diplomatic means or bank transfer

YOUR DUTY:
You will receive funds and await further instruction, before the commencement of the any investment project you stand to retain 20% of the principle sum, and after the investment project is been embarked upon the profit will be shared 60% for us and 40% for you.
We are banking on your trust to act in this capacity, if you are interested in this partnership forward the following information to enable us prepare a legal paper work that will bind us in this transaction.

1 Legal Name 
2 Contact mailing Address 
3 Telephone and Fax Number
I would appreciate reply via my phone,fax or email id above.
Thanks in anticipation of your favorable response to our proposal and acct in dispatch

Sincerely 
Barrister Frank Green
