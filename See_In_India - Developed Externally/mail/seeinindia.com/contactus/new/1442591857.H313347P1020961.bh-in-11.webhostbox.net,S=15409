 Dear Sir, I sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy, especiall=
y by contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this m=
agnitude. I contacted you via web SMS because my mobile telephone package d=
oes not send or receive messages. For this reasons, I want our communicatio=
n to be basically through email for now. I want you to partner with me in g=
etting back the money (US$4,800,000.00) left behind in a fixed deposit acco=
unt in our bank by a citizen of your country, Mr. Rao Prasad Venkateshwara.=
 If this will endanger your position and reputation, I would not have conta=
cted you. This is safe and beneficial. I am presently the operations manage=
r of our bank in Ohio, United States of America and please do not expose th=
is transaction for any reason, I will give you more information of myself, =
our bank and the transaction itself once you write again. Late Mr. Rao Pras=
ad Venkateshwara lived and worked in New York City as an international busi=
nessman. He deposited in our bank the sum of Four Million, Eight Hundred Th=
ousand US Dollars (US$4,800,000.00) as fixed deposit. This deposit has long=
 matured and has gone dormant for about two years. We have tried to reach h=
im and could not. His telephone number could not be reached, emails sent to=
 him kept bouncing back as undelivered and we never got any response from t=
he letters posted to his residential address. This issue prompted me to car=
ry out an independent investigation about his whereabouts since he did not =
provide a next of kin or beneficiary at the time he made the deposit with u=
s. I later realized with shook that he died sometime in November 2010 of he=
art related illness in a Los Angeles hospital. His death was not reported t=
o our bank from that time till this moment and nobody in our bank is aware =
of this. He was a kind hearted man and give money out freely. I pray his so=
ul rest in peace However, I have on my own made several enquiries at your e=
mbassy and no information of him was found, which I find weird. My effort t=
o locate any of his relatives took me to your country and the regional pass=
port office in New Delhi informed me that the passport number was irrelevan=
t and not issued anywhere in India. Since this is the issue, I want you to =
apply as the next of kin of the deceased to claim the deposit from our bank=
 since it is assumed he was from India. It does not matter whether you knew=
 him or not, it does not matter if you have any kind of relationship with h=
im or not. I will guide you all the way to make this claim. This is not a m=
atter of being greedy or having ugly morals, it is not the best to leave th=
e money to eventually end up in Government hands while we have the opportun=
ity to live better with it. This is a risk free transaction, as I am the op=
erations manager of our bank and the final approval of your application wil=
l be done by my department. Once it is approved, you will have the right to=
 claim the money. And when it is transferred to you, I will come to meet wi=
th you in order to share the money which will be into two equal parts (50:5=
0) for each of us after deducting all the costs incurred in getting the mon=
ey. With my influence, our bank will tender the necessary documents to appr=
opriate authorities, like your country's central bank (RBI) to enable a smo=
oth transfer of the money into your bank account. Everything will be done l=
egally, have no fear about this. Right now, I have all the copies of the do=
cuments relating to the fixed deposit late Mr. Rao Prasad Venkateshwara mad=
e that you will file to back up this claim. All I require now is your hones=
t cooperation to enable us make this claim and we have to do this within sh=
ortest time possible. If you are willing to do this with me, write back and=
 I shall inform you on what next to do. If nothing is done immediately, the=
 money will be returned to the government treasury as an abandoned fund and=
 we will gain nothing from it. I am waiting for your consent in order to mo=
ve to the next step towards getting the fund. Please Email me on my private=
 email: (christopher_white7@hotmail.com).Thank you and I am waiting. christ=
opher_white7@hotmail.com Best regards, Christopher White
